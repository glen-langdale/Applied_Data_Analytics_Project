Impact of Air Quality on Urban Health Outcomes Explore how variations in air quality indices affect health outcomes, such as hospital admissions for respiratory issues. Use publicly available air quality datasets and health statistics. Look at measures such as PM2.5 and PM10.

Maybe compare Dublin to a city in China or India or Canada (wild fire areas?)

Look at data over the last 5-10 years.

Maybe predict the impact in 2050?

# Applied_Data_Analytics_Project
Impact of Air Quality on Urban Health Outcomes Explore how variations in air quality indices affect health outcomes, such as hospital admissions for respiratory issues. Use publicly available air quality datasets and health statistics. Look at measures such as PM2.5 and PM10.

# Scope
* Compare Dublin to a city in China or India or Canada (wild fire areas?)
daily PM10 or PM2.5 data for a town in Ireland per year - [EPA Ireland](https://eparesearch.epa.ie/safer/dataAndResources/mostPopularResources.jsp?type=download)
* Air Quality data found here for [Ireland](https://airquality.ie/readings)
* Health Outcomes found here from [CSO](https://data.cso.ie/) - use DHA78 - Total Hospital Discharges by Principal Diagnosis and Area
* Look at data over the last 5-10 years (2017 - 2023)
* Predict the impact in 2035
